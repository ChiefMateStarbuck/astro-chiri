The sun has such a profound effect on mood.
If you were to sit under Karl’s[^Karl] nose for half a year, you would forget the blissfulness that the sun offers to us every day.
Love the sun.
The sun is power and joy.
You feel like Superman.

There’s this Twitter tech persona that bases his entire image on Superman.
His pinned tweet is a picture of Henry Cavill’s Superman dripped out with a smiling grill, diamond rings, and a large diamond watch.
**Lustrous** really.
Emotions of victory, and large capital gain swirling through your body: waves of egotistical joy emanating throughout the entire ether of the internet.
**Lustrous** really.

This feeling should hug you every morning.
Light on your face reminds you of the oneness of the universe.
I am not I, you are not you. We are one.
Looking from the ultimate perspective of high above all, we will see that we are one.
Hate, love, kindness, retribution, disdain, motivation, laziness - are all but different shades and façade of the blissful tranquility and peace that is the One; the absolute algorithm; the perfect formula; flawlessly designed.

Love the sun.
The sun loves you.
